mem rendering:
	- make each line its own rect, might make optomising easy
	- 0xF or 0x20 entries wide

Drawing:
	dont clear screen, as RAM changes rarely?
	draw blocking elements for game/RAM, allowing '~120Hz' for game
	have seperate calls to update upper and lower halves?
	draw pixels to a surface for game rendering?
	text array recreated each frame?

.h
	memory is array, not portable (but who cares)
.cpp
deconstructor doesnt free ram (reduntant once ram moved, if ever)


ADD not affectign AC?
0x76 HLT not implemented
sub and SBB carry weirdness | check if  simple uint16 sub cant be used
sign-extension and all that
f1 use POP, but not increment PC itself

confirm shift register working correctly
1980400 is good start point for JS emu
