mem rendering:
	- make each line its own rect, might make optomising easy
	- 0xF or 0x20 entries wide

cycle timing may need checking
	- draw timers nested instead of being seperate?
	- cycletime inluding drawing good?

Drawing:
	dont clear screen, as RAM changes rarely?
	draw pixels to a surface for game rendering?
	text array recreated each frame?
	text[8]=q?

.h
	memory is array, not portable (but who cares)
.cpp
deconstructor doesnt free ram (reduntant once ram moved, if ever)


ADD not affectign AC?
0x76 HLT not implemented
sub and SBB carry weirdness | check if  simple uint16 sub cant be used
sign-extension and all that
